This project involves transmitting text from one computer to another using a laser as the communication medium. The choice of laser communication is ideal due to its low noise ratio, making it highly reliable for data transmission. To achieve this, an Arduino is utilized to program the laser, enabling it to send binary bits as signals to a solar panel. The solar panel decodes these binary numbers and translates them into characters, effectively conveying the text message.
